                                            <p>A couple of weeks ago I attended the Adobe Summit at London's ExCeL exhibition centre. Along with the usual high-budget, no expense spared venue and celebrity keynote speakers were a number of interesting and insightful breakout sessions, categorized into themed 'tracks' and based on the 'data informing marketing decisions' theme that underpinned the whole two-day extravaganza. I generally stuck to the Personalisation and Optimisation stream.</p>

                                            <p>I'll get my gripes out of the way first. My initial one: too many attendees. Compared to the previous year there seemed to be a lot more, resulting in queues for every escalator, lift and staircase. This wouldn't have been a problem if it had been tightly organised, but delegates who had pre-registered for sessions (I don't remember that even being a requirement last year) were denied access to sessions because they were allegedly full.</p>

                                            <p>Second gripe: while it was fascinating to hear Professor Brian Cox talk about the Hadron Collider and big data, and Benedict Cumberbatch giving us his engaging insights into playing Alan Turing and Smaug in the Hobbit, their links to the overall theme of the conference were tenuous to say the least. It seemed more a show of financial muscle by Adobe than anything else; certainly last year's keynote speakers were more relevant to the theme. That said, both were interesting and highly entertaining, as was Claudia Winkleman as guest presenter of the Adobe Sneaks slot (showcasing Adobe's prospective new products).</p>

                                            <p>These gripes aside, the breakout sessions on personalisation and optimisation were, on the whole, packed full of great stuff.</p>

                                            <p>The first one I went to - <strong>Personalisation &amp; Optimisation: where on earth do I start?</strong> - was co-hosted by Adobe's Jamie Brighton and Martin Firth from MoreThan. Firth spoke openly about the challenges of getting optimisation started in a large financial services organisation, while Brighton stressed the importance of a focus on people, process and product in order to be successful.</p>

                                            <p>These gripes aside, the breakout sessions on personalisation and optimisation were, on the whole, packed full of great stuff.</p>

                                            <p>Here are the key take-outs from the session:</p>

                                            <p>Web personalisation, according to Firth, is something that should be baked into your strategy at the outset. It isn't a technology. The process of personalisation follows these distinct steps:
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>Awareness</li>
                                                    <li>Consideration</li>
                                                    <li>Self-identification</li>
                                                    <li>Cross-sell/up-sell</li>
                                                    <li>Advocacy</li>
                                                </ol>
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Companies need to provide personalisation across the entire customer journey. Not just email for example.</p>

                                            <p>The customer profile is dependent on:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Environment variables</li>
                                                    <li>Behaviour variables</li>
                                                    <li>Offline variables</li>
                                                    <li>Temporal variables</li>
                                                    <li>Referrer variables</li>

                                                </ul>
                                            </p>

                                            <p>The secret of personalisation success is:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Starting simple</li>
                                                    <li>Getting organised and committed</li>
                                                    <li>Customer-centric personalisation</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </p>


                                            <p>You don't need to do complex personalisation. MoreThan rewarded return visitors with a 15% off campaign, and saw great results.</p>

<p>The next session I went to was Adobe Target in 'real-life': driving optimisation in Target, led by Adobe's Andrew Hawkins and with contributions from Rudger de Groot, from Conrad Electronic Benelux. The interesting thing about Conrad Electronic is that even though they aren't that far down the line with optimisation and personalisation, their aim is to carry out 200 A/B tests this year. Whilst this provokes the age-old argument of quality over quantity (and it did in the Q&amp;A session at the end) it is still an admirable goal. Especially as the more tests you run, usually the higher the percentage of winners. </p>

<p>The key take-outs:

<ul>
    <li>Rookies focus on tactics, pros use processes. You can't run a successful optimisation programme without a solid foundation.</li>
    <li>Concentrate on 'JFDI' tests, that are high impact, and easy to implement. Conrad use what they call ‘base analysis’ to identify test candidates from data.</li>
    <li>They don’t talk in ‘tests’, they talk in ‘test cycles’, and use Kanban or Trello boards to manage the testing roadmap. There is a need to manage multiple testing streams concurrently.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>They have a FACT and ACT approach - 7 steps to learn.
    <ol>
    <li>Find</li>  
    <li>Analyse</li>  
    <li>Create</li>  
    <li>Test</li>
    <li>Analyse results</li>  
    <li>Conclude</li>  
    <li>Tell</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>You need to define rules for this type of approach to maintain a high testing velocity; and consider custom tracking, level of significance, and which browsers &amp; devices to target.</li>
    <li>Find and validate your segment. Make sure it's big enough. Otherwise you might get false positives.</li>
    <li>They implemented a ‘content type’ meta tag as a parameter in Target. Helps to target your test on a certain template, and to do analysis on the front-end. </li>
    <li>Analyse which KPIs do you want to test on. Sample size and test duration calculator:
    <a href="http://abtestguide.com/calc">http://abtestguide.com/calc</a>. Using a calculator like this helps minimise the risk of 'false positives’. They use a power ratio of 80% to prevent false positives.</li>
    <li>A handy tip is to use mutually exclusive groups in Target to avoid test overlap.</li>
    <li>Create a copy of the control version. This ensures that page loading time isn’t affected negatively.</li>
    <li>You want to preview your test in staging as if it were live, using preview URLs. </li>
    <li>Use real-time tracking, use the duration calculator, and don’t stop it too soon.</li>
    <li>Conrad also use Adobe Report Builder to track the test. </li>
    <li>Look beyond the obvious metrics, dig deeper into other segments.</li>
    <li>If you find a winner outside the test’s scope, make sure you retest with mutually exclusive groups.</li>
    <li>Spread the message - socialise the results! You need to get people behind the idea of A/B testing. They post their results on a community board which can be shared internationally.</li>
</ul>
