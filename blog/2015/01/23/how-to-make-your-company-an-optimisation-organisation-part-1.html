                                            <p>The term 'optimisation organisation' was first coined by Adobe, but it has now become part of the vernacular in digital marketing circles. It represents the panacea for organisations that aspire to a culture of continuous improvement by adopting test and learn activities.</p>

                                            <p>In parts 1 and 2 of this blog post, we outline 12 things that you should do to become an optimisation organisation.</p>

                                            <p><ol style="margin: 0; padding: 0;"><li style="list-style-type: none; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>1. Start thinking about testing!</strong><br />
                                            It's never too late to start test and learn activities in your company. To do it properly, though, you will need to think about how you can achieve the best results. This will involve devising an end-to-end testing process, involving external stakeholders and building an optimisation team. You need solid foundations in place before you can start building for future success.</li>

                                            <li style="list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>2. Data should drive your test ideas</strong><br />
                                            Every test idea you come up with should be grounded in an analytics insight. A problem statement such as 'we are seeing a higher than expected drop-off of 15% from our landing page to our purchase page' is far more powerful than 'we think we should be selling more products', and also allows you to be much more strategic in developing a programme of related tests and coming up with meaningful testing hypotheses.</li>

                                            <li style="list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>3. Invest in an A/B &amp; multivariate testing tool</strong><br />
                                            The volume and complexity of testing you want to carry out, and the scale of your organisation, will dictate which tools you use for your optimisation work. Companies like Adobe and Maxymiser have enterprise-scale A/B and multivariate testing tools that come with a high price tag, but provide the ability to carry out multiple and complex tests with user-friendly reporting suites, and sometimes consultancy included in the package. At the lower end of the cost scale, Optimizely offers an impressive testing package with an intuitive interface but more limited functionality.</li>

                                            <li style="list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>4. Invest in some help early on</strong><br />
                                            It's easy to think you can do it all yourself - remember, though, that despite the fact that testing doesn't need to be complex, doing it right takes time and effort. We can't stress enough how important it is to enlist help to get you started on your testing efforts - whether from an external consultancy, or from the company who owns the software - as this will let you get up and running with minimal delay, so you can get the most out of your optimisation efforts.</li>

                                            <li style="list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>5. Get senior stakeholder buy-in</strong><br />
                                            This one is absolutely critical. Without executive-level representation your optimisation efforts run the serious risk of never getting traction. Any company trying to become an optimisation organisation will at some stage come up against major hurdles (e.g. lack of development resource, slow IT release cycles) that threaten to derail the whole strategy. So you need the buy-in of a senior sponsor who can fight your corner and stump up budget when needed.</li>

                                            <li style="list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>6. Have an optimisation lead</strong><br />
                                            Organisations that try to execute an optimisation strategy without a dedicated optimisation lead generally fail. The optimisation lead is the 'glue' that holds together all your testing efforts. Better still, create a dedicated optimisation team that can focus purely on generating and running tests. Without a dedicated testing function you start to rely on other departments' resources and your testing roadmap risks running out of steam.</li>
