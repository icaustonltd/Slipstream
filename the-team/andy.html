                                            <p>Andy is a digital specialist, with specific experience managing and delivering commercially successful digital projects. With over 14 years’ experience, Andy has worked in both agency-side and client-side roles in the UK and Australia, optimising the digital offerings of household brands such as Direct Line Group, AMP-AXA, Marks & Spencer, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Dixons Group, Caltex and WeightWatchers.</p>

                                            <p>Andy started his digital career as a project manager on large-scale web builds at the pioneering agency Wheel, and before long had transitioned to a digital producer role, cutting his teeth on wireframes, site maps and functional specification documents for financial services and retail blue chips. He then moved into the area of web usability and accessibility, before specialising in digital acquisition marketing, with a focus on search engine optimisation, paid search and email marketing strategies for his corporate clients.</p>

                                            <p>His entrepreneurial disposition and enthusiasm for the web led Andy to set up his own digital micro-business in 2006, creating and developing a number of affiliate financial services websites, and a site focused on improving early childhood literacy. At the same time, his breadth of digital knowledge earned him a role at Australia’s fifth largest fund manager, heading up the digital team.</p>


                                            <p>After re-locating to the UK, Andy was recruited as Customer Engagement Manager at Direct Line Group, where he was responsible for optimising the customer journey across all of the general insurer’s digital channels, both desktop and mobile. He was subsequently seconded as Product Owner to the Direct Line Group’s digital transformation programme, where he was responsible for the successful implementation of new brochureware and quote & buy pages across the group’s general insurance brands (Direct Line, Churchill, and Privilege), on the Adobe CQ5 platform. The project took a mobile-first, responsive design approach, and was one of the first in the industry to be run entirely using the agile methodology.</p>


                                            <p>Andy was also responsible for devising and implementing the Group’s digital optimisation strategy, including the deployment of the Adobe Target tool, and has rolled out an A/B and multivariate testing roadmap for the organisation.</p>
